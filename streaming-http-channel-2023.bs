  The [[!Solid.Notifications.Protocol]] defines a set of interaction patterns for agents to receive notification
  about changes to resources in a Solid Storage.

  This specification defines a channel type that applies these patterns to the Fetch API.

# Introduction # {#introduction}

*This section is non-normative.*

The [[!Solid.Notifications.Protocol]] describes a general pattern by which agents can be notified when a Solid Resource changes.
In the context of a Web Browser, the Streaming HTTP Channel provides a convenient mechanism for a Solid Storage
to alert a subscribing client of these changes.

This document describes a Solid Notifications channel type that makes use of the Fetch API.

This specification is for:

* Resource server developers who wish to enable clients to listen for updates to particular resources.
* Application developers who wish to implement a client to listen for updates to particular resources.

# StreamingHTTPChannel2023 Type # {#channel-type}

This specification defines the StreamingHTTPChannel2023 type for use with Solid Notifications channels.
that use the Fetch API.

An StreamingHTTPChannel2023 MUST conform to the [Solid Notifications Protocol](https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol#discovery).

An StreamingHTTPChannel2023 SHOULD support the [Solid Notifications Features](https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol#notification-features).

The StreamingHTTPChannel2023 type further constrains following properties properties:

: receiveFrom
:: The [receiveFrom](https://solid.github.io/notifications/protocol#notify-receiveFrom) property
    is used in the body of the subscription response.
    The value of source property MUST be a URI, using the `https` scheme.

A client establishes a subscription using the StreamingHTTPChannel2023 type by sending an authenticated
subscription request to the Subscription Resource retrieved via Solid Notifications discovery.

For StreamingHTTPChannel2023 interactions, the client sends a JSON-LD payload to the appropriate
Subscription Resource via POST. The only required fields in this interaction are type and topic.
The type field MUST contain the type of channel being requested: `StreamingHTTPChannel2023`
The topic field MUST contain the URL of the resource a client wishes to subscribe to changes.

## Subscription Example ## {#example}

*This section is non-normative.*

An example `POST` request using a `DPoP` bound access token is below:

```http
POST /subscription
Authorization: DPoP <token>
DPoP: <proof>
Content-Type: application/ld+json
```
```jsonld
{
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notification/v1"],
  "type": "StreamingHTTPChannel2023",
  "topic": "https://storage.example/resource",
  "state": "opaque-state",
  "endAt": "2023-12-23T12:37:15Z",
  "rate": "PT10s"
}
```
> POST request including type and topic targeting the Notification Subscription Resource.

A successful response will contain a URL to the subscription Resource that can be used directly with a JavaScript client.

```http
Content-Type: application/ld+json
```
```jsonld
{
  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/solid/notification/v1",
  "type": "StreamingHTTPChannel2023",
  "receiveFrom": "https://fetch.example/aca3cb0a-fb0a-4091-b9f8-8117d2cdb392"
}
```
> Response to the POST request, including channel type and the receiveFrom URL.

In JavaScript, a client can use the data in the response to establish a connection to the Fetch API.
And define how to handle notifications

```js
const response = await fetch('https://fetch.example/aca3cb0a-fb0a-4091-b9f8-8117d2cdb392')
const textStream = response.body.pipeThrough(new TextDecoderStream());
for await (const notificationText of textStream) {
  parseAndHandle(notificationText)
}
```

Issue(46):

# Authentication and Authorization # {#auth}

Streaming HTTP Channel has the advantage of being able to authenticate with the Subscription Resource
as well as the notifications `receiveFrom`. The same *access token* can be used with both resources.
This doesn't just rely on the notifications source being a [Capability URL](https://www.w3.org/TR/capability-urls/)
as many other channel types do.

As described by the Solid Notifications Protocol section on Authorization,
the Streaming HTTP Channel requires authorization and follows the guidance of the Solid Protocol
sections on Authentication and Authorization [[!Solid.Protocol]].

It is beyond the scope of this document to describe how a client fetches an access token.
Solid-OIDC is one example of an authentication mechanism that could be used with Solid Notifications [[!Solid.OIDC]].
